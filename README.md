# Doten
Better Dota Analytics

# What this is:
I like Dota 2, I like graphs. This repo is a collection of tools to analyze your dota games and compare them againt the pros to better your game. 

This repo takes the .json replay files generated by the `odota parser` and extracts important information about when and where certain events happen. 

For now, it is broadly broken out into `Farm`, `Kills`, `Wards`, and `Deaths`, and for the Bayseans among you, each of these is broken into 4 different maps. 
Each map is "From the perspective of team X given win condition Y". So Given you played radiant and won, where and when did you get your farm?

All maps are displayed as density maps, with the height axis being time. 

#How to run

Install the prerequisites, and put your replay JSONs in a `/replays` folder. 
If you want, break that into 1kmmr, 2kmmr etc folders, and edit `parser.py` to accomodate. Currently it is set up for 3kmmr and 7kmmr. On the TODO list to make that adaptable.
Run `parser.py`!

You'll get some HTML files that look like the following:
![Definitely not one of my games >_>](https://github.com/mltq/doten/blob/master/media/3kmmr_farm.png?raw=true)

##Note: Currently not updated for 7.34c map layout. 

How to get replay CSVs:
1. get java & maven, set JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME paths
2. get https://github.com/odota/parser and build with mvn /path/to/parser/jar (name) package
3. run the odota server
4. curl localhost:5600 --data-binary "/path/to/replays/6464136573.dem" -o "6464136573.json"
5. run the python parser
